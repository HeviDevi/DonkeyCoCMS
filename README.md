# DonkeyCoCMS

## Description

I wanted to create a content management system that was functional and fun. The application serves as an employee management system for a company called DonkeyCo, run by Hank The Donkey. This project was motivated by the desire to streamline the process of managing employee information in a funny yet efficient manner. It solves the problem of manual record-keeping and employee data management. Through this project, I learned about Node.js, command-line applications, and interacting with a PostgreSQL database.

1. Ensure you have Node.js and PostgreSQL installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

4. Set up your PostgreSQL database and note the connection details.
5. Update the database connection details in the application's configuration file.
